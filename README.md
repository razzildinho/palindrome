# Python Integer Palindromes

A simple script for generating a csv file with decimal numbers converted to the lowest possible base such that the integer is palindromic.

### Running the script

running `python palindrome.py` will generate an `output.csv` file which contains the decimals, bases and palindromic integers. Running `python test.py` will run the unit tests.
